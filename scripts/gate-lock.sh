# One gate at a time, per working tree.
#
# Two gates running in ONE tree corrupt each other: they share `engine/target`,
# and the tell is a cargo error blaming a test rather than your code ("the
# binary the runner was about to execute was deleted underneath it"). That is
# easy to hit from an agent harness, where a "quick" second command lands while
# a long gate is still going in the background.
#
# The lock is keyed by WORKING TREE, not by machine: separate worktrees keep
# separate `engine/target`s and may run gates in parallel, which is the whole
# point of isolating a parallel session in a worktree.
#
#   scripts/gate-lock.sh <command> [args...]
#
# Re-entrant: a nested gate (`make quiet T=verify` invoking `make verify`)
# inherits the hold through SHOJIKU_GATE_HELD and does not deadlock.
#
# SHOJIKU_GATE_DIR puts the marker somewhere shared, so `ls` shows every
# running gate across every worktree at once. It defaults to a path inside
# this tree, which needs no configuration and still locks correctly.
