# Reads the lcov.info `make coverage` already wrote — it does NOT re-run the
# gate, so this is instant. `cargo llvm-cov` is invoked with --lcov, which
# writes the machine-readable report to a file and prints no per-file table, so
# a failing run otherwise says only "below the threshold" with no file named.
#
# Coverage counts each crate TWICE (its own unit-test binary + the copy linked
# into dependents' test binaries), so lcov holds several SF blocks per file.
# That split is reported separately: a line covered in one copy and not the
# other is the trap CLAUDE.md warns about, and it reads very differently from a
# line no test reaches at all.

# it is the case this message exists for — the alternative was reading a stale
# report and naming lines that a compile error means nothing ever reached.

		coverage-why: no $LCOV — the run wrote no report.

		  If 'make coverage' just failed, it failed BEFORE measuring anything.
		  The usual cause is a test that does not compile, and the real message
		  is the rustc error in the gate log:

		    grep -n 'error\[' .make-logs/coverage.log

		  If you have not run the gate yet, run 'make coverage' — it writes the
		  report this script reads.
