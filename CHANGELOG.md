# Changelog

Notable changes to Shojiku, newest first. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the
project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Every published version ships as one set — the engine, the CLI, the
Docker image and all seven SDKs carry the same version number, so an
entry here applies to whichever of them you use unless it says otherwise.
A release's [GitHub Release](https://github.com/kengos/shojiku/releases)
page carries the same notes with the install instructions and the
platform binaries.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Absurd font sizes and stroke widths now fall back with a warning
  instead of reaching the geometry.** `fontSize` and `lineHeight` accept
  up to 1000 each, and the `line` item's `style.width` joins the
  0..=1000 pt bound `borderWidth` already had. Past those, the value
  warns (`font_size_out_of_range`, `line_height_out_of_range`,
  `invalid_line_width`) and the engine draws at its default — 10 pt, 1.4
  and 1 pt respectively. The two font caps are a pair: their product is
  the tallest line box the engine will build, which is exactly the
  ±1,000,000 pt limit every other length already obeyed. `fontSize` was
  the one length that escaped it, so a huge finite size could drive the
  line-height and advance sums toward values no longer representable.
  Real documents are nowhere near — the largest font size in any bundled
  example is 46 pt — and an authored `width: 0` on a `line` is still
  legal and silent.

- **The homepage playground now runs a released engine, and says which
  one.** It used to run whatever was on `main`, so a visitor could try a
  fix in the browser and then install a package without it — the demo
  ran ahead of the product. The engine the site serves is now pinned to
  a published release and moves only when a release moves it, and the
  site states which version that is — read from the running binary's own
  report rather than written down beside it.

### Fixed

- **Long text that splits across pages now redraws its whole box on
  every fragment.** Only the first piece of the decoration used to carry
  over, so a text with per-side `borderWidth`s kept its top border and
  lost the other three — and that survivor was then stretched to the
  fragment's height, painting a solid block of border colour over the
  text. Dashed and dotted sides disappeared entirely, and
  `borderStyle: double` lost its second stripe. Every side, stripe and
  dash now redraws at each fragment's own height (CSS
  `box-decoration-break: clone`), on both the horizontal split and the
  vertical-writing column split.
- **A `minHeight` taller than the text survives the split.** The
  reserved space and the `verticalAlign` offset distributing it were
  both dropped once the text paginated, so a bottom-aligned block
  jumped to the top of its fragment and the split output was only as
  tall as its lines. The slack above the content now leads the first
  fragment and the slack below it trails the last, so the fragments
  still sum to the reserved height.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-02

First release: a deterministic PDF document engine for business
paperwork. A document is two YAML files (template + field catalog) plus
JSON data, and the same input renders byte-identical PDFs from the CLI,
Docker, every SDK and browser WASM.

- **Layout** — containers with `%`/flex/grid, data-driven tables with
  repeating headers and pagination, n-up imposition, vertical writing
  with ruby and kinsoku, character grids (原稿用紙, 〒 entry cells), form
  marks, QR codes, links, images.
- **Locale packs** — ja-JP and en-US built in; zh-TW, zh-CN, hi-IN and
  fil-PH shipped as data, so one template renders many locales at the
  same geometry.
- **Tooling** — `validate` / `preview` / `inspect` with machine-readable
  diagnostics, an MCP server, and the browser Designer.
- **Signing** — PDF incremental-update signing and a verifier that
  reports what it did *not* check.
- **SDKs** — Python, Ruby, Node, .NET, Java, Go and PHP, all against one
  frozen lifecycle contract.
